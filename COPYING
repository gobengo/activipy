All code here dual licensed under Apache License v2.0 and GPL v3 or
later, as published by the Free Software Foundation.

(Why both when Apache v2 and GPLv3 is effectively just Apache v2?
Well, future compatibility is a minor concern.  Also, the founder of
this package thinks that being in a camp on one or the other and
shaking fists at each other is an annoying and self-defeating
pasttime, so there's a bit of community commentary here: both
approaches are great, choose strategically!)

You ought to find some copies of those licenses in this directory, as
long as nobody mucked things up!
