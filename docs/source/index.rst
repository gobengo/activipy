Activipy: Your pythonic social network toolkit
==============================================

Activipy (pronounced "activi-pie")
is an `ActivityStreams 2.0 <http://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/>`_
toolkit for Python.  It helps making your application or website social
while keeping things fun.

ActivityStreams is a JSON (and optionally,
`json-ld <http://json-ld.org/>`_) representation of "who's doing what",
simple to understand and easy to implement on your own website.
ActiviPy makes things extra easy for you by including the full basic
`ActivityStreams vocabulary <http://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/>`_,
which means that you have the appropriate language to discribe common
social network type interactions.  This makes it easy to build a world
where various servers can speak the same language about common
activities.  If your application does something more complicated,
don't worry, ActivityStreams has an extension mechanism, and Activipy
is built to help you take advantage of it.  Jump on in!
