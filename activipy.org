Python is an imperative language; we won't try to be "purely
functional" but "hidden state" could really screw us, so we'll try to
reduce that as much as possible.

We need:
 - Use a gdbm backed activitystreams object storage
 - For extensions, pyld
 - verifiers
 - method dispatch

DMD store should store in a dictionary like:
... with the key being the "@id" of the toplevel activitystreams
object.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  {"asobj": {"@type": "Object",
             "@id": "uuid:d773cb99-078b-496b-b3f0-012d3ade5930",
             "blah": "blah"},
   "private": {"blah": "blah"}}
#+END_SRC

We are going to have to handle inheritance manually, because there can
be multiple types.  We can't use python's inheritance system.

We need an "ASVocab" system to operate within.  This one should have
a memoized version of the json-ld expansion of the default
activitystreams vocabulary, but it should also have a mapping of
type URIs to ASClass objects.

The store will be used separately, should provide simple store and
retrieve mechanisms.

Some complexity comes from the fact that in a "real world" system, we
don't just store and receive what's been given to us.  We need a way
to trigger application-specific hooks.

* Tasks
** TODO ActivityStreams "classes"

Note that normal python classes can't work here.

*** TODO Absolute basics
**** TODO Constructors
**** TODO ???
*** TODO Add inheritance / method dispatch system

This is trickier than one may think; we can't do Python style 
method resolution because an activity may have multiple types.

** TODO Add basic GDBM based store

This might eventually 

** TODO Add verifier system
** TODO Hook up pyld
*** TODO Save that context
** TODO Tests
** TODO Fill in complete vocabulary
