    BTW, you might wonder why this isn't using python class heirarchies
    as an abstraction.  The reason is simple: ActivityStreams objects
    can have multiple types listed under @type.  So our inheritance
    model is a bit different than python's.

# So, questions for ourselves.  What is this, if not merely a json
# object?  After all, an ActivityStreams object can be represented as
# "just JSON", and be done with it.  So what's *useful*?
#
# Here are some potentially useful properties:
#  - Expanded json-ld form
#  - Extracted types
#    - As short forms
#    - As expanded / unambiguous URIs (see json-ld)
#    - As ASType objects (where possible)
#  - Validation
#  - Lookup of what a property key "means"
#    (checking against activitystreams vocabulary)
#  - key-value access, including fetching any nested activitystreams
#    objects as ASObj types
#  - json serialization to string
#
# Of all the above, it would be nice not to have to repeat these
# operations.  If we've done it once, that should be good enough
# forever... in other words, memoization.  But memoization means
# that the object should be immutable.
# 
# ... but maybe ASObj objects *should* be immutable.
# This means we copy.deepcopy() on our way in, and if users want
# to change things, they either make a new ASObj or get back
# entirely new ASObj objects.
#
# I like this idea...
